"""Integration tests for the live watcher / incremental tree updates.

These exercise the real path the MCP server uses: when a file is saved, the
background watcher must reparse it and update the cached tree in the SQLite DB.

They are hermetic: `get_llm_client` is forced into no-LLM mode so no API key or
network call is required. Embeddings use the locally-cached ONNX model.
