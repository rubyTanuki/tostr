"""The `tostr.lock.json` format: read, write, and version it in one place.

This is the *generated-but-committed* description lockfile at the project root — a third file
category alongside the committed authored config (tostr.toml / .tostrignore) and the gitignored
.tostr/ cache. One person parses (paying the LLM cost once) and runs `tostr export` to commit this
file; everyone else's first `tostr parse` seeds descriptions from it instead of re-calling the LLM.

Separation of concerns: this module owns only the *serialization format* (JSON shape, deterministic
output, version stamp + compatibility gate, no-op write). It deals in plain `{uid: {...}}` entry
dicts and paths — it never touches the database. Gathering the entries from the cache is the
Registry's job (`Registry.collect_descriptions`); orchestrating the two is the command's job
(`commands.export_lockfile`). Because it depends only on `cache_version`, both `registry` and
`commands` can import it without an import cycle.
